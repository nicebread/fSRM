Description: The package computes Social Relations Analysis with roles ("Family
    SRM"), using a structural equation modeling approach. Groups ranging from
    three members up to an unlimited number of members are supported and the
    mean structure can be computed. Means and variances can be compared between
    different groups of families and between roles.
