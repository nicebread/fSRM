- variable naming within fSRM object:
	- syntax = lavaan syntax?
	- model = lavaan object?
	
- formula: + for "only main effects", * for "including relationship effects"
- long or wide format?
	- How to add additional non-round-robin variables to the analyses? E.g. age
	- Converter fucntion from standard wide format to long format?
	
- Changes to model syntax: The user has to know how to name the variables (because in the long format they have other names than in the original wide format)

- Remove the "add"-parameter from fSRM: simply provide the complete syntax in "model"

- include mean effects (cf. Rasbash)

- group comparisons (multi-group SEM)

- case studies (additional function after fSRM has been fit)

- instead of "fe=FALSE": drop = c("group", "actor", "partner") in case of three members

- getCor function: show all (co)variances, even the negative ones

- styling option: use "actor" instead of "A" in the syntax, etc.

- resestimation: no recursion, make another function: reestimate(x)
	- if a variance is set to zero, also remove the covariances with it
	- ask Yves: covariance with a variance component that is set to zero? Difference: remove it or leave it in the syntax?
	
- single indicator: set all error variances to zero and remove all error correlations
	- Print a note in the output: now it's relationship + ERROR variance!
	- in relative variance table: remove "error" and "explained" column
	
	
	
HOWTO improve model fit:
1. Set negative variances to zero.
2. Do everything that is theoretically justified, e.g. adding IGSIM

Based on MIs > 10:
3. Set a factor loading free (i.e., don't constrain it to 1) (if a MI warrants that)
4. Let two factors correlate without a theoretical foundation (beyond the reciprocities)
