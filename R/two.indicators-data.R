#' The classic Cook (2000) dataset consists of measurements on
#' security of attachment within families. Only the variable
#' measuring attachment dependency in family relationships is
#' included in this dataset. Four roles are present (i.e. two parents and two children):
#' mothers "m", fathers "f", the older
#' child as "c", and the younger child "y".
#'
#' The variables are as follows:
#'
#' \itemize{
<<<<<<< HEAD
#' \item family.id An indicator for the family.
#' \item actor.id An indicator for the perceiver, either "m", "f", "c", or "y".
#' \item partner.id An indicator for the target, either "m", "f", "c", or "y".
#' \item dep1 first measurement of attachment dependency.
#' \item dep2 second measurement of attachment dependency.
