\title{Data set on negative interactions}
\format{A data frame with 3276 rows and 6 variables (208 families with 4 members each, round-robin design)}
\description{
A simulated dataset, mimicking the study performed by Eichelsheim et al. (2011) who investigated whether there are 
differences in patterns of negativity between families with and without an adolescent with externalizing problem 
behavior. The problematic and nonproblematic group consist both of 120 and 153 four-person families, respectively. 
This dataset contains two measures of negativity for each of the 12 relationships.
Four roles are present: Mothers "m", fathers "f", the older child "c", and the younger child "y".

\itemize{ \item family.id An indicator for the family.
