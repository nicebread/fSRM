# Version 0.3

- renamed data sets and changed some column names from the output

# Version 0.2.6

- mod() function now works with mean structure and delta method if lavaan >= 0.5.16 is installed
- added a data set based on Eichelsheim (2011): data(two.groups)
- Fixed minor bug in print.fSRM with multiple groups

# Version 0.2.5

- Now prints a warning if it is attempted to automatically set negative variances to zero in the multiple-group case (Not implemented yet).
- Added helper functions which help to import data sets from different formats: `import()`

# Version 0.2.4

## New Features

- Negative variances can be automatically set to zero: setZero = "negative", or set all non-significant variances to zero: setZero = "nonsig". Please note: The purpose of this function is to reproduce published results; usually it is *not* recommended to set non-significatn variances to zero! This parameter does not work yet with multiple groups.
- Included two data sets, based on Bill Cook's (2000) study: Attachment anxiety in 4-person families (three.person and four.person, see also http://davidakenny.net/kkc/c9/c9.htm), and attachment dependency (two.indicators)

# Version 0.2.3

- renamed parameter for `drop`: before: "reciprocities", now: "GR"
- renamed parameter for fSRM: before: "delta", now: "diff"
- minor fixes

# Version 0.2.2

## New Features

- Delta method now also compares variances between two groups
- Delta method works for 3-person families, and with dropping of factors
- equalMeans() now provides a Wald test for equality of relationship effect means

## Changes and Bug Fixed

- `drop` does not remove the factor, but rather sets its variance to zero.
- Improved output of the mod() function
- Mean structure for 3-person family now works correctly
- The family effect now is included in the delta method

# Version 0.2.1

## New Features

- Replaced `fe` parameter in fSRM by `drop`: Now the user can drop either the family effect, the actor, the partner effects, or the reciprocities when only three members are present.
- New function equalMeans() tests actor and partner means for equality
- Implemented delta method: all means of two groups can be compared simultaneously. Set `delta=TRUE`and `group="group"`in fSRM, and you're done!

## Changes

- The structure of the raw data is not shown anymore when executing the fSRM function
- Fixed some inconsistencies in labeling
- Preliminarily dropped analyses with self-ratings (they probably will be added later again)
- Removed error correlations type "within": This has been described in the literature, but actually never been used.
