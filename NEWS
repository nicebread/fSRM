# Version 0.2.1

## New features

- Replaced `fe` parameter in fSRM by `drop`: Now the user can drop either the family effect, the actor, the partner effects, or the reciprocities when only three members are present.
- New function equalMeans() tests actor and partner means for equality
- Implemented delta method: all means of two groups can be compared simultaneously. Set `delta=TRUE`and `group="group"`in fSRM, and you're done!

## Changes

- The structure of the raw data is not shown anymore when executing the fSRM function
- Fixed some inconsistencies in labeling
- Preliminarily dropped analyses with self-ratings (they probably will be added later again)
- Removed error correlations type "within": This has been described in the literature, but actually never been used.
