# Version 0.2.3

- renamed parameter for `drop`: before: "reciprocities", now: "GR"
- renamed parameter for fSRM: before: "delta", now: "diff"
- minor fixes

# Version 0.2.2

## New Features

- Delta method now also compares variances between two groups
- Delta method works for 3-person families, and with dropping of factors
- equalMeans() now provides a Wald test for equality of relationship effect means

## Changes and Bug Fixed

- `drop` does not remove the factor, but rather sets its variance to zero.
- Improved output of the mod() function
- Mean structure for 3-person family now works correctly
- The family effect now is included in the delta method

# Version 0.2.1

## New Features

- Replaced `fe` parameter in fSRM by `drop`: Now the user can drop either the family effect, the actor, the partner effects, or the reciprocities when only three members are present.
- New function equalMeans() tests actor and partner means for equality
- Implemented delta method: all means of two groups can be compared simultaneously. Set `delta=TRUE`and `group="group"`in fSRM, and you're done!

## Changes

- The structure of the raw data is not shown anymore when executing the fSRM function
- Fixed some inconsistencies in labeling
- Preliminarily dropped analyses with self-ratings (they probably will be added later again)
- Removed error correlations type "within": This has been described in the literature, but actually never been used.
